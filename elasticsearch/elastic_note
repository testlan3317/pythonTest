Logstash install
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elastic-keyring.gpg

You may need to install the apt-transport-https package on Debian before proceeding:

sudo apt install apt-transport-https

save the repository definition to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list:
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elastic-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list

Stashing first event:
cd /usr/share/logstash
bin/logstash -e 'input { stdin{ } } output { stdout{} }'
-e: enables you to specify a configuration directly from the command line. 


Install FileBeat (it is used to send log lines to logstash, used to collect logs from files on the server and forwards logs to logstash instance)
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-8.8.0-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i filebeat-8.8.0-amd64.deb


1. Filebeat will attempt to connect on port 5044
2. Until Logstash starts with an active Beats plugin, there won't be any answer on that port, so any messages you see regarding failure to connect on that port are normal for now.

grok:
The grok filter plugin enables you to parse the unstructured log data into something structured and queryable. 
Because the grok filter plugin looks for patterns in the incoming log data, configuring the plugin requires you to make decisions about how to identify the patterns that are of interest 
to your use case.

You need to force Filebeat to read the log file from scratch. To do this, go to the terminal window where Filebeat is running and press ctrl+c, then go to /usr/share/filebeat/bin/data/, delete
the registry file 
sudo rm data/registry

Elasticsearch install
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg

sudo apt install apt-transport-https

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/package/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list/elastic-8.x.list

sudo apt update && sudo apt install elasticsearch

After you install elasticsearch
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service

if you have password-protected your elasticsearch keystore, you will need to provide systemd with the keystore password using a local file and systemd environment variables.
This local file should be protected while it exists and may be safely deleted once Elasticsearch is up and running. 

e.g.
echo "keystore_password" > /path/to/my_pwd_file.tmp
chmod 600 /path/to/my_pwd_file.tmp
sudo systemctl set-environment ES_KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE_FILE=/path/to/my_pwd_file.tmp
sudo systemctl start elasticsearchi.service

Note:
By default, the Elasticsearch service doesn't log information in the systemd journal. To enable journalctl logging, the "--quiet" option must be removed from the ExecStart command line in 
the elasticsearch.service file. 



/etc/systemd/ vs /usr/lib/systemd/
Basically, files that ships in packages downloaded from distribution repo go into /usr/lib/systemd/system.
Modifications done by system administrator go into /etc/systemd/system



rm /usr/share/filebeat/bin/data
sudo ./filebeat -e -c filebeat.yml -d "publish"

bin/logstash -f first-pipeline.conf --config.test_and_exit
bin/logstash -f first-pipeline.conf --config.reload.automatic
