Planning and configuring Security Updates
All software contains bugs. Often, these bugs can result in a vulnerability that can expose your system to malicious users. Pakcages that have not been updated are a common 
cause of computer intrusions. implement a plan for installing security patches in a timely manner to quickly eliminate discovered vulnerabilities, so they cannot be exploited.

Test security updates when they become available and schedule them for installation. Additional controls need to be used to protect the system during the time between the release
of the update and its installation on the system. These controls depends on the exact vulnerability, but may include additional firewall rules, the use of external firewalls, 
or changes in the software settings.

Bugs in supported packages are fixed using the errata mechanism. An erratum consists of one or more RPM packages accompanied by a brief explanation of the problem that the 
particular erratum deals with. 
All errata are distributed to customers with active subscriptions through the "Red Hat Subscription Management" service. Errata that address security issues are called
"Red Hat Security Advisories"

Redhat 8:
Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) document the information about security flaws being fixed in Redhat products and services
Each RHSA includes the following information:
- severity
- Type and status
- Affected products
- summary of fixed issues
- Links to the tickets about the problem. Note that not all tickets are public
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers and links with additional details, such as attack complexity.

Redhat Customer Portal provides a list of Red Hat Security Advisories published by Red Hat. you can display details of a specific advisory by navigating to the advisory's ID from
the list of Red Hat Security Advisories.

1. Display security updates that are not installed on a host

# yum updateinfo list updates security

2. Display security updates installed on the host:

# yum updateinfo list security --installed 

If multiple updates of a single package are installed, yum lists all advisories for the package. 


3. Displaying a specific advisory using yum

# yum updateinfo info <Update ID>
e.g. # yum updateinfo info RHSA-2019:0997


3.1 viewlist of CVEs which affects the system by using:
 # yum updateinfo list cves

3.2. view the packages which is belongs to bugfixs
 # yum updateinfo list bugfix 

3.3 get a summary of advisories, which needs to be installed on your system
 # yum updateinfo summary



4. Installing all available security updates

4.1 install security udpates using yum
    # yum update --security
      --security is a must, it indicates the security

    Optional: list processeses that require a manual restart of the system after installing the updated packages:
    # yum needs-restarting

4.2 Installing a security update provided by a specific advisory
    In certain situations, you might want to install only specific updates. 
    For example, if a specific service can be updated without scheduling a downtime, you can install security updates for only this service, and install the remaining security updates later. 
4.2.1 Install a specific advisory:
    # yum update --advisory=<Update ID>
    
    Optional: List the processes that require a manual restart of the system after installing the updated packages:
    # yum needs-restarting










5. Installing security udpates automatically
5.1 Install dnf-automatic using yum
    # yum install dnf-automatic

5.2 open "/etc/dnf/automatic.conf" file
5.3 configure the upgrade_type = security option in the [commands] section:
[commands]
# what kind of upgrade to perform:
# default      =   all available upgrades
# security     =   only the security upgrades
upgrade_type = security

5.4 Enable the "systemd timer unit"
# systemctl enable --now dnf-autmatic-install.timer

Redhat 7:

1. To check for security-related updates available for your system. 
   # yum check-update --security
The command return an exit value of 100 when there are any security updates available and 0 when there are not. On encountering an error, it returns 1.

2. install security-related updates:
   # yum update --security

3. Applying changes introduced by installed Updates
After downloading and installing security errata and updates, it is important to halt the usage of the old software and begin using the new software. 

Application - relaunch

Kernel - restart

KVM - 
when the qemu-kvm and libvirt packages are updated, it is necessary to stop all guest virtual machines, reload relevant virtualization modules (or reboot the host system),
and restart the virtual machines.

Use the "lsmod" command to determine which modules from the following are loaded: kvm, kvm-intel, or kvm-amd. 
Then use the "modprobe -r" command to remove and subsequently the "modprobe -a" command to reload the affected modules. 
e.g.
# lsmod | grep kvm
# modprobe -r kvm-intel
# modprobe -r kvm
# modprobe -a kvm kvm-intel

Shared Libraries - 
shared libraries are units of code, such as "glibc", that are used by a number of applications and services. Applications utilizing a shared library typically load the shared
code when the application is initialized, so any applications using an updated library must be halted and relaunched. 

To demtermine which running applications link against a particular library, use the "lsof" command

# lsof library
