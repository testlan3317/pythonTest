switch performance troubleshoot
components of a catalyst switch
1. Ports
2. Forwarding Logic - ASICs
3. BackPlane
4. Control Plane


Control Plane | (where all the intelligent resides in the switch)-this is something we must think to guard.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Plane    | (governed by the ASICs, where your ports coming in and the MAC)

s1# config t
s1(config)# do show interface counters      # quick way to diagnose slowniess issue. this give you a quick view on what interfaces are doing what
s1(config)# do show interface counters errors   # shows errors statistics for the interfaces

-- duplex mismatch
s1# show interfaces | include half

Switch TCAM Troubleshooting
1. switch backplane rarely cause an issue; TCAM (ASICs) tables can max out
2. when the TCAM table is Full, traffic goes to CPU (PUNTING)
3. Punting is a normal condition ( SSH, Routing protocols, CDP, ETC...)
4. "Switch Death" can occur when you use a low-end switch in place of a high-end switch to save money
5. verify correct SDM template is in place for your required features
6. Verify TCAM utilization


s1# show sdm prefer

s1(config)# sdm prefer ?
access               Access bias
default              Default bias
dual-ipv4-and-ipv6   Support both IPv4 and IPv6
ipe                  IPe bias
routing              Unicast bias
vlan                 VLAN bias

-- check tcam utilization
s1# show platform tcam utilization

CPU utilization
1. switch cpu utilization matters - it should remain low
2. cisco recommended 5% -10% maximum levels of processing
3. what could cause high cpu?
   1) Tcam overload (STP loop?)  2) Debug command left running  3) frequent routing or FHRP updates 4) Frequent SNMP Scans

Router Performance Troubleshooting:

R1# show processes cpu

R1# show processes cpu | exclude 0.00%
R1# show processes cpu | include ^CPU|^ PID|ARP IN
R1# show processes cpu | include ^CPU|^ PID|Net Back
R1# show processes cpu | include ^CPU|^ PID|IP Back
R1# show processes cpu | include ^CPU|^ PID|TCP Tim
R1# shwo processes history

High CPU Utilization Sources
1. ARP Input Process - A flurry of arp packets; can be caused by a default router pointed at an out ethernet interface
2. Net background process - when an interface queue is Full, Net background pulls from a a 'Global' Buffer (causes cpu interruppt)
3. IP Background process - Handles Interface UP/Down states
4. TCP Timer process - manages developing and current tcp connections to the router

High Memory Utilization Sources:
1. cause of memory shortages: not meeting minimum requirement for IOS version you are running
2. cause of memory shortages: memory leak (ios bug)
3. cause of memory shortages: buffer leak (ios bug)
4. cause of memory shortages: bgp (Giant Routing table)
R1# show processes memory

sw1(config)# int fa2/0/2
sw1(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan ?
WORD     VLAN IDs of the allowed VLANs when this port is in turnking mode
add      add VLANs to the current list
all      all VLANs
except   all VLANs except the following
none     no VLANs
remove   remove VLANs from the current list

sw1(config-if)# switchport trunk allow valn add 1,4,6,8
