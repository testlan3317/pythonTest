# synchronization
# - synchronization between processes
# - Pooling of processes

# process synchronization is defined as a mechanism which ensures that two or more concurrent processes do not 
# simultaneously execute some particular program segement known as "critical section".

# "Critical section" refers to the parts of the program where the shared resource is accessed.

"""
Concurrent accesses to shared resource can lead to race condition

A race condition occurs when two or more processes can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time.
As a result, the values of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of context switches of 
the processes.

About variable _

Underscore _ is considered as "I don't care" or "throwaway" variable in Python

It's just a variable name, and it's conventional in python to use _ for throwaway variables. It just indicates that the loop variable isn't actually used.


The python interpreter stores the last expression value to the special variable called _.

>>> 10
10

>>> _
10

>>> _ * 3
30
The underscore _ is also used for ignoring the specific values. If you donâ€™t need the specific values or the values are not used, just assign the values to underscore.

Ignore a value when unpacking

x, _, y = (1, 2, 3)

>>> x
1

>>> y
3
